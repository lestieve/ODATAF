# ODATAF

**Open DATA Federator (ODATAF)**

ODATAF is a module that allows you to perform SQL queries on different data sources by federating them into a "data federation". The data is collected in a single SQLITE database. The result of queries can then be exported into different file formats (Excel, CSV, Json, sql, ...).
ODATAF provides a Tkinter interface for:
- simply manage the import of new sources into the data federation,
- define the links (joins) between the different data sources
- create new queries by selecting the fields to use, creating new joins or by defining filters
- execute queries and export the result into different formats (Excel, CSV, Json, sql, ...)
- save queries in data federation
- save query results in data federation
- save federation to a file (.odf extension)
- select the settings of the application (choice of language) and save them
